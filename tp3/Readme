## TP 3

### Structure

```
algorithm_em.py contains my own EM algorithm for multidimensional data
algorithm_singledim_em.py is the code provided in the TP wrapped in a class to meet the sklearn API
gaussian_mixture_models.py contains all the code for this TP.
```

### Best bics and optimal number of component for each data set:
```
Two informative features, one cluster per class -- lowest_bic=812.4087134629405, best_n_component=2
Three blobs -- lowest_bic=1624.24700733203, best_n_component=3
Non-linearly separated data sets -- lowest_bic=507.5767378886685, best_n_component=4
Mice Protein Expression -- lowest_bic=-282144.24355174904, best_n_component=4
Breast Cancer -- lowest_bic=-38148.47774325236, best_n_component=2
```

### Exports

In the exports directory you will find the plots of the data and the clusters find by my own home made EM algorithm and the ones find by the EM algorithm from sklearn.

### Comments

EM algorithm performed correctly when the clusters are convex/connex that is because of the gaussian mixture assumption.
