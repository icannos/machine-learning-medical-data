## TP 1 : Diabete Remission 

You can find in the folder `exports` the graph generated by the script. In addition to what was asked, I ran a small decision tree model to have a more 
readable decision graph.

Feature importance from random forests:

```
        age     hba1c  insuline taken  other drugs taken
   0.464728  0.125007        0.329246           0.081019
```

The three models are quite simple ones and the results of the three are consistent. The age is the most crucial criterion
to take into account then if insuline is taken and `hba1c`. There is no need to use a very complex model to make accurate 
prediction on those data.
