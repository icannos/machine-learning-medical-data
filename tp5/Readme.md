## TP 5

You'll find the plots of the classification frontier in the `export` directory and my own implementation of the logistic regression in the file `logistic_regression.py`.

`mllab.py` contains some helpers to draw the plots. 

Using 10-cross validation we get results of the same order of magniture but with less variance on the error estimation and both the logistic regression implementation work.
